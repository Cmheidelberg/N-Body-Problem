# N-Body-Problem

This simulator was developed as a final project for the USC PHYS-304 Classical Mechanics class. This project was designed to be a simple, yet powerful, tool to simulate the N-Body problem. For more information about this project see the PDF located in the root of this repository: [Simulating_the_N-Body_Problem_in_Python.pdf](Simulating_the_N-Body_Problem_in_Python.pdf).

Additionally, a demo of the program can be found on youtube: [PHYS304 N-Body Simulation Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts0lCdWYIDE)

## Depenencies:
To run the program each of the following dependencies will need to be installed.

Install Numpy:
`python3 -m pip install numpy`

Install MatPlotLib
`python3 -m pip install matplotlib`

python3 -m pip install scipy
`python3 -m pip install scipy`

python3 -m pip install pyglet
`python3 -m pip install pyglet`

## Running the program:

Once the dependencies have been installed the simulator can be run by executing the python `main.py` file found in the `/src` folder. Ie: `$ python3 src/main.py`

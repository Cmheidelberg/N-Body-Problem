# N-Body-Problem

## Depenencies:
Before you can run the program each of the following dependencies will need to be installed.

Install Numpy:
`python3 -m pip install numpy`

Install MatPlotLib
`python3 -m pip install matplotlib`

python3 -m pip install scipy
`python3 -m pip install scipy`

python3 -m pip install pyglet
`python3 -m pip install pyglet`

## Running the program:

Once the dependencies have been installed you can run the program by navigating to the root of the project `N-Body-Problem/` and typing: `python3 src/main.py`. (Note: you can run the main from any directory). In future releases I will enable support for the N-Body-Problem simulator (nbp) to work as a pip package.
